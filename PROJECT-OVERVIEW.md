# 20. Suggested Disclaimer

## General Application Declaration

“I declare that the information and documents submitted in this application are true, complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I understand that Odeda Local Government may verify any information provided. I further understand that false information, forged documents, misrepresentation or non-disclosure may result in the rejection of my application or the suspension, cancellation or revocation of any certificate, licence, permit or approval issued.”

## Payment Disclaimer

“All fees paid through the Odeda Local Government LOGMAS platform are official application, processing, assessment, rate, levy, licence, permit or certificate fees. Payments are non-refundable after successful processing, except in cases of confirmed duplicate payment, excess payment or payment-system error formally verified and approved by Odeda Local Government. Rejection of an application does not automatically create a right to a refund.”

## Certificate Disclaimer

“A certificate, licence, permit or approval is valid only when its QR code or verification number returns a valid record on the official Odeda Local Government LOGMAS verification page. Any alteration, duplication, forgery or unauthorised use may lead to cancellation and possible legal action.”
